HeadHunter Project: Salary Model

## Project Description

HeadHunter aims to build a model that automatically determines the approximate salary level suitable for users based on the information they provide. Before constructing the model, it is necessary to transform, explore, and clean the data. This is our task!

## Organizational Information

Our project will be divided into four parts:

1. **Basic Analysis of Data Structure:** Exploring the fundamental characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Transformation:** Preparing the data for further analysis and model building.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** In-depth exploration of the data to identify patterns and regularities.

4. **Data Cleaning:** Handling outliers, missing values, and improving the overall data quality.
